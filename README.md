# About
An NRF24 based controller system that currently supports 10 buttons and a joystick. You can use a Leonardo or other compatible device to connect to a computer using DirectInput (I may add support for XInput in the near future).
# Libraries needed
https://github.com/nRF24/RF24 for transmitter

https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary for a DirectInput receiver

https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput/ for a XInput receiver
